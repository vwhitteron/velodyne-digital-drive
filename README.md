The current release of Digital Drive and Digital Drive for Artison Portrait Software is 1.6. This version, released November 2004, adds discrete remote codes. These codes are all of the codes on the Digital Drive remote control. These codes work with the DD-10, DD-12, DD-15 and DD-18. The file also contains eight IR codes that are not on the Digital Drive remote: new discrete codes for power on/off, mute on/off, night mode on/off and light on/off. These discrete codes will only work with the Digital Drive Version 1.6 software.

The current release of Digital Drive and Digital Drive for Artison Portrait Software is 1.5, released May 28, 2004. Release 1.5 fixes a minor bug relating to the auto on/off feature for both the Digital Drive Software and Digital Drive for Artison Portrait Software. Some Digital Drive units will not properly auto shutoff without this correction. Release 1.5 contains the updates made in previous releases as documented in the Read Me file. 

To upgrade your software, you'll need an IBM compatible PC with an available RS-232 serial port and a male to female "mouse extension" serial cable. If you need a cable, contact us at support@velodyne.com.

## OLD README CONTENT

Initial Versions of Digital Drive subwoofers shipped with release 1.2. The release number can be seen in the upper left hand corner of the main screen (the screen with the Velodyne logo on it). 

Release 1.3 corrected an issue with 100-volt (Japanese export) versions. 

Release 1.4 changes the default preset to 4, and maximizes the theater music (servo loop gain) setting during the sweep. There were no changes to the performance or features of the unit, however several minor bugs relating to inadvertent overlaying of screen characters were also addressed. 

The Artison 1.4 software reflects a new partnership program. Artison and Velodyne have teamed up to determine optimal settings for Artison Portrait loudspeakers. The software reflects the changes in the default crossover, phase, and preset settings to optimally match the Artison Portraits with Digital Drive subwoofers. We expect to partner with more speaker manufacturers in the future. 

Release 1.5 fixes a minor bug relating to the auto on/off feature for both the Digital Drive Software and Digital Drive for Artison Portrait Software. Some Digital Drive units will not properly auto shutoff without this correction. 

NOTE: Release 1.5 contains the upgrades and changes made on all previous releases.
